# RLE-xml-db
RLE assessment documentation in xml format

repository of xml documents with basic information for each assessment units

need to make a separate repository for creating a simple spatial database with:

assessment unit (name, id) / assessment scope / assessment type / assessment protocol / overall category / assessment reference / spatial data source description / bounding box / simplified geom (10km grid) / full geom / convex hull / AOO count / EOO area / other extent measure / status (original data, best available alternative, proxy geom, not available, etc ) / comments

Another table to link these to the 10x10 global grid: grid id, assessment unit, area
